UV Admin provides a branded control panel and cleaner editor UI.

## Installation
1. Upload `uv-admin` to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate from the WordPress admin.

## Shortcodes & Hooks
This plugin does not expose public shortcodes or custom hooks.

## Requirements
- WordPress 6.0+

## Example Usage
Once activated the WordPress dashboard and editor are automatically styled; no shortcodes are required.

## Translation
All user-facing strings are translation ready. The plugin loads the `uv-admin` text domain from its `languages` directory so translations can be provided via standard WordPress `.po`/`.mo` files or translation plugins.
