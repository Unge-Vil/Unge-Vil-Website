UV Admin provides a branded control panel and cleaner editor UI.

## Installation
1. Upload `uv-admin` to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate from the WordPress admin.

## Shortcodes
`[uv_display_name]` â€“ outputs the current user's display name.

## Usage
Once activated the WordPress dashboard and editor are automatically styled. Set the `uv_admin_control_panel_page_id` option to use a custom page for the Control Panel. That page can include the `[uv_display_name]` shortcode for personalized greetings.

## Requirements
- WordPress 6.0+

## Translation
All user-facing strings are translation ready. The plugin loads the `uv-admin` text domain from its `languages` directory so translations can be provided via standard WordPress `.po`/`.mo` files or translation plugins.
