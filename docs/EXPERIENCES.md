# Experiences

## Adding an Experience
1. In the WordPress dashboard, go to **Experiences → Add New**.
2. Enter a title, content, and optional featured image and excerpt.
3. Assign a **Location** term if relevant.
4. Publish the Experience.

## Linking to a Blog Post
When editing an Experience, use the **Related Post** meta box in the sidebar to choose an existing blog post. Select **— None —** if no blog post should be connected.

## Linking to an External Website
Use the **External URL** meta box to provide a link to an outside website. If filled in, the Experience will display a “Visit website” button beneath the content and team members.

## Linking to a WordPress User
Use the **Team Members** meta box (`uv_experience_users`) to associate one or more WordPress users with an Experience. Start typing in the selector to search and choose people; multiple users can be selected. On the front end, the selected users appear beneath the Experience content with their profile details. Team visibility is managed separately through User → Location assignments.

## Attaching Partners
Use the **Partners** meta box to associate one or more partner posts with the Experience. Begin typing in the selector to search for partners and select as many as needed. The chosen partners will be displayed after the team members on the front end.
