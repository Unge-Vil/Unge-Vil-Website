# Experiences

## Adding an Experience
1. In the WordPress dashboard, go to **Experiences → Add New**.
2. Enter a title, content, and optional featured image and excerpt.
3. Assign a **Location** term if relevant.
4. Publish the Experience.

## Linking to a Blog Post
When editing an Experience, use the **Related Post** meta box in the sidebar to choose an existing blog post. Select **— None —** if no blog post should be connected.

## Linking to a WordPress User
Experiences do not include a dedicated user selector. If needed, you can store a user reference in a custom field or mention the user in the content. Team visibility is managed separately through User → Location assignments.
