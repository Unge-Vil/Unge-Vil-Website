# User Locations

## Assigning Locations to a User
1. Edit a user profile in the WordPress dashboard.
2. In the **Public Profile (Unge Vil)** section, use the **Locations** multi-select to choose one or more departments/locations.
3. Save the profile.

The plugin stores the selected locations on the user and creates or removes **Team Assignment** posts as needed.

## Editing Assignments
Assignments can also be managed directly via **Team Assignments** in the admin menu for fineâ€‘grained control (role titles, order, primary contact).
