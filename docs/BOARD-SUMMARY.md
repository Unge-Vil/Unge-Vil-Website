# Unge Vil Website — Board Summary (Plain Language)

**Deadline:** 1 September — publish a clean, fast website with:
- Home page (hero, locations, two call-to-action banners, latest news)
- “Who we are” pages, donation info, concept/model pages
- Team pages per location with primary contacts clearly highlighted
- English-ready (we start in Norwegian but can translate later)

**Later phases (after launch):**
- Partner directory
- Advanced translations for content
- More automation/import tools

**Why this approach:** It is low-cost, accessible, fast, and easy to maintain. Editors can add news and update team info without technical skills.

**What’s ready now:**
- A starter theme and small plugins to model Locations, Team members, Partners, etc.
- Branded admin control panel that is simple for editors.
- SEO & privacy best-practice defaults, and a staging plan.

**How volunteers help:**
- Write short “who we are” and “what we do” texts.
- Provide photos (landscape 16:9 for pages, square for avatars/logos).
- Add team quotes (Norwegian + optional English).

**Risks & mitigations:**
- Limited dev time → We intentionally keep code small and use WordPress standards.
- Translations take time → We launch Norwegian first, add English gradually.
- Content bottleneck → We run a short “content sprint” (checklist provided) to gather everything quickly.

**Looking for helpers:** Much of the code was created with assistance from ChatGPT (“vibe-coded”). We welcome contributors who know WordPress/PHP to review and improve it.
