# SEO Plan

## Technical
- Ensure pretty permalinks, XML sitemaps (SEOPress/Rank Math), and canonical URLs.
- Use a single H1 per page; logical H2/H3 structure.
- Add alt text to all images; keep filenames meaningful.
- Use `uv_location` taxonomy for posts to enable local landing pages.
- Add Organization schema on Home/About; Event schema when events go live.

## Content
- Write clear page titles (<= 60 chars) and meta descriptions (<= 155 chars).
- Use short intros (40–80 words) and scannable sections.
- Internal links: from Home → Locations; Locations → News & Team.
- For Locations, include city name in titles (e.g., “Unge Vil Haugesund — …”).

## Local SEO
- Create a “Contact” page with address (if any), email, and social links.
- Consider a Google Business Profile per city when relevant.

## Launch checklist
- Connect to Google Search Console.
- Submit sitemap URL (from SEO plugin).
- Check robots.txt and noindex settings (staging vs production).
