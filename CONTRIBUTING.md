# Contributing

We’d love help! Much of this was scaffolded with ChatGPT and kept intentionally small.
If you know WordPress, PHP, accessibility, or design, please jump in.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo, create a feature branch.
2. Keep code lightweight and accessible (semantic HTML, WCAG AA).
3. Write in English for code/comments; end-user copy can be Norwegian.
4. Open a Pull Request describing changes and screenshots.
5. Run `npm install` once, then `npm run lint` (or `npm test`) before pushing to catch JavaScript issues early.

## Areas where help is welcome
- Code review and security hardening
- Gutenberg block patterns for our components
- Import/export tools (CSV) for team assignments and partners
- Translation polish for GTranslate fallbacks or future manual `.po` files
- Performance & testing
