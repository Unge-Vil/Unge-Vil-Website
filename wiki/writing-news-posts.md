# Writing News Posts

News posts keep the community informed and should follow a consistent structure. You only need the standard WordPress editor—no code or developer tools.

## Creating a Post

1. Go to **Posts → Add New** in the dashboard.
2. Enter a concise title that matches the main message.
3. Write the content in the editor. Use headings, lists, and quotes to improve readability.
4. In the **Locations** panel, select the correct location so the story appears on the right department page.
5. Add a **Featured Image** to draw attention on listings.
6. Select categories and tags that describe the topic (e.g., `Nyheter`).
7. Use the **Excerpt** field for a short summary; this appears in previews.

## Scheduling and Publishing

- Use the **Publish** panel to schedule a future publish date or publish immediately.
- Click **Preview** to check formatting, links, and image credits before publishing.
- Publish when you are ready. GTranslate will handle the English view automatically.

## Post-Publish Tasks

1. Confirm the post shows on the correct location page; edit the **Location** term if needed.
2. Share the post on social media if appropriate.
3. Monitor comments and respond when needed.
4. Update the post if new information becomes available.

By following these steps, team members can create engaging and consistent news content for the site.
