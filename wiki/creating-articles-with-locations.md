# Adding Articles with Locations

Articles can be associated with a specific location for better discovery. This applies to **Posts**, **Experiences**, **Activities**, and **Partners**.

1. From the dashboard open the content type you need (e.g., **Posts → Add New** or **Experiences → Add New**).
2. Enter a title and body content using the normal editor.
3. In the **Locations** panel choose the relevant location. If you do not see your location, ask an administrator to add it.
4. Set featured images and categories as needed for that content type.
5. Click **Publish** when the item is ready.

The item will now appear in location-based listings throughout the site and on the department page for that location.
